<p align="center">The 3DAPE Software is a useful tool for tracking human poses from multiple video
files and exporting them in an FBX file format. The software aims to help animators, game developers,
and virtual reality creators to save time and effort in creating realistic human movements and
animations.</p>
<p align="center">The project objectives were successfully met by developing a software application that uses pre-
trained pose estimation models and video synchronization techniques to extract and track human poses
accurately across multiple video files. The software also provides a user-friendly interface for importing
and exporting video files and setting up the tracking parameters.</p>
<p align="center">The software was designed and developed using libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyQt5,
OpenGL, and FBX SDK, which ensure its technical feasibility and reliability. The software was also
found to be economically feasible, operationally feasible, legally feasible, and schedule feasible based
on the feasibility study.
Overall, the Human Pose Tracking Software has the potential to provide significant benefits to the
animation, gaming, and virtual reality industries, and it can be further enhanced in the future with
additional features and functionalities.</p>
